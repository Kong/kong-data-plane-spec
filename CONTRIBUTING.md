## Contribution guidelines

### Technical

- Keep things as simple and dumb as possible. Keeping Kong Gateway simple
  and minimal when it comes to CP-DP communication and protocol is one of the
  most important goals of this project.
- Do not optimize for tiny performance gains. While the protocol can have
  substantial improvements, we have not yet found a systemic performance issue.
  Performance is a secondary concern.

### Non-technical

- Please send smaller and incremental PRs over large ones.
- Use multiple PRs if discussions get overly lengthy.
- PR author is responsible for moving the PR through the discussion.
- All participants in a comment thread are responsible for getting the thread
  to conclusion.
- Most importantly, stay curious.
